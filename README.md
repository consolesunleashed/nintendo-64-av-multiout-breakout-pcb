# Nintendo 64 AV Multiout Breakout PCB

A simple little PCB to help when RGB modding an N64. Add this little PCB to the multioutâ€™s PCB pins and solder wires to this PCB instead of directly to the pins. Much neater. There's a jumper to rout the sync to different output pins.

## Donate

Working on designs to release for free can be both time consuming and expensive. If you like what I do, a small donation will go a long way in helping me continue to serve the modding community as best as I can, with many more free and original guides, designs, and ideas to come.
